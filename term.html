        <strong>Purchase Policy</strong> <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Payment Methods</strong> <br>
        <br>
        The Event Organizer.com accepts Visa, MasterCard, American Express, select Debit Cards, Net Banking, Cheque/DD, Bank
        Transfer and Direct Bank Deposits.<br>
        <br>
        <strong> Who You Are Buying From?</strong><br>
        <br>
        The Event Organizer.com acts as the agent to those who are promoting the events for which you purchase tickets
        ("Event Organizer"). When you purchase a ticket for an event, The Event Organizer.com will be handling the
        transaction and collecting payment for the organizer.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Pricing and Availability</strong> <br>
        <br>
        The Event Organizer.com sells tickets on behalf of Event organizers and does not control the inventory or its
        availability.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Amount of Tickets Per Customer or "Ticket Limits" </strong><br>
        <br>
        When purchasing tickets on The Event Organizer.com you are limited to a specified number of tickets for each
        event.<br>
        <br>
        <strong> Order Confirmation </strong><br>
        <br>
        If you do not receive a confirmation number (in the form of a confirmation page or email) after submitting
        payment information, or if you experience an error message or service interruption after submitting payment
        information, it is your responsibility to confirm the same from your booking history or with the Customer
        Service Department whether or not your order has been placed. Only you may be aware of any problems that may
        occur during the purchase process. The Event Organizer.com will not be responsible for losses (monetary or
        otherwise) if you assume that an order was not placed because you failed to receive confirmation.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Billing Information Verification </strong><br>
        <br>
        Some Orders will be processed only after a billing address, and other billing information, has been verified.
        Occasionally, we receive incorrect billing or credit card account information for a ticket order that can delay
        processing and delivery. In these cases, The Event Organizer.com customer service will attempt to contact you, using
        the information provided at the time of purchase. If The Event Organizer.com is unable to reach you after its
        initial attempt, The Event Organizer.com may cancel your order and may sell your tickets to another customer.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Pricing and Other Errors</strong> <br>
        <br>
        If the amount you pay for a ticket is incorrect regardless of whether owing to an error in a price posted on
        this web site or otherwise communicated to you, or you are able to order a ticket before its scheduled on-sale
        or pre-sale date or you are able to order a ticket that was not supposed to have been released for sale, then
        The Event Organizer.com will have the right to cancel that ticket (or the order for that ticket) and refund to you
        the amount that you paid. This will apply regardless of whether because of human error or a transactional
        malfunction of this website.<br>
